This repository is created as a final project for the Deep Learning for Computer Vision summer school at UPC, Barcelona.

Team 1 is formed by Armand Comas, Victor Aubin & Guillem Par√≠s

# Spatial Transformer Net

Original code from Pytorch tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/spatial_transformer_tutorial.html
Edits based on DeepMind Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025

Provided code's goal is to learn how to perform spatial transformations of the input image in order to preserve, as much as possible, the geometrical invariance of the model.
