# Team 1 - DLCV Summer School - UPC

This repository is created as a final project for the Deep Learning for Computer Vision summer school at UPC, Barcelona.

Team 1 is formed by Armand Comas, Victor Aubin & Guillem Par√≠s

# Spatial Transformer Net

Original code from Pytorch tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/spatial_transformer_tutorial.html

Provided code's goal is to learn how to perform spatial transformations of the input image in order to preserve, as much as possible, the geometrical invariance of the model.

Applying STNet to distorted images improved the classification results by 3% with MNIST dataset & 5% with GTSRB dataset.
